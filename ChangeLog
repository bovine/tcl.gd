ChangeLog for tcl.gd
====================
2012-10-31 karl
    * Use interpreter-associated data for the next object number for
      GD objects created with a name of "#auto" rather than a global.

      Although this should not have caused any problems with multiple
      threads using tclgd simultaneously, better safe than sorry.

    * New function, tclgd_imageRewriteColor, rewrites one color to another
      for indexed and truecolor images.  Not used yet.

2012-06-17 bovine
    * Fix possible memory leak in tclgd_channelNameToIOCtx

    * Fix memory deallocations to use ckfree() instead of gdFree() (Issue 1)

2011-10-26 karl
    * Correct "rectangle" method to create a non-filled rectangle.  (We were
      incorrectly calling gdImageFilledRectangle instead of gdImageRectangle.)

2011-06-15 karl
    * Expand docs.

2011-01-18 karl
    * Version bump to 1.1.  Tagging 1.1 for release.

2010-12-07 karl
    * Document the alpha_blending and save_alpha methods.

2010-11-16 karl
    * Make the "compare" method work.

2010-11-15 karl
    * Make the "get_alpha" method, which returns the alpha component of the
      specified color index where 0 is completely opaque and 127 is
      completely transparent, work properly.

    * Make "set_brush" and "set_tile" methods work properly.

    * Make the "style" method work.

2010-11-08 karl
    * Add compare_ratio method -- given a second image of identical dimensions,
      returns the ratio of identical pixels between the images.

2010-08-12 karl
    * Upgrade to Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA) 3.8.

2010-03-22 karl
    * Upgrade to Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA) 3.7.

2009-11-04 karl
    * Add pixelrgb method -- given an x and a y in an image, returns the
      red, green and blue components as a list.

2009-11-02 karl
    * Add rgb_components method -- given a color it returns a list of the
      red, green and blue components.  This is the same as invoking the
      red_component, blue_component and green_component methods and returning
      the result as a list.

2009-05-01 karl
    * Add -lgd to link libraries -- that it worked before was due to the 
      FreeBSD port modifying the output of "gdlib-config --libs".
      (fix for googlecode issue 1).

    * Remove autom4te.cache upon "make distclean".

    * Version bump to 1.0.

2009-03-31 karl
    * Builds cleanly under Debian.  Added README.Debian that explains how
      to configure.

2009-02-23 karl
    * Fixed potential buffer overflow problem and potential wraparound problem
      with #auto object naming and thread safety problems as reported by 
      George Peter Staplin:

	* Folded tclgd_newObjName into tclgd_newGDObject.

	* Removed static buffer used for object name construction and
	  sized new one large enough to support long longs without overflow.

	* It now tries as many object names as needed to find one that doesn't
	  collide with any existing objects (usually only takes one).

	* Made next object number variable into an unsigned long.

    * Another bug reported by George Peter Staplin is that a crash can
      by caused by passing the copy methods (copy, copy_resized, etc) 
      a Tcl command that is not one of our GD objects.  Although not
      a complete fix for the problem, we now insure when looking at
      one of these names that its clientData pointer is not null before
      dereferencing it to get to the frame buffer.

    * Also at GPS's suggestion, change from getting the result object
      with Tcl_GetObjResult and setting it with Tcl_SetIntOBj, etc, 
      set the object result using newly created objects and Tcl_SetObjResult.

    * Version bump to 0.7.

2009-02-21 karl
    * tcl.gd 0.6 released to the public.

2008-05-22 karl
    * Fixed problem with GD create_from_jpeg_data looking at the wrong argument
      for the binary data.

    * Fixed a thing where the GIF anim begin code could complain about a 
      global color map problem when really it was a local color map problem.

2007-08-16 karl
    * Document that "font" in the text and text_bounds calls is the path
      to a TrueType (.ttf or .ttc) file and that we do not support the
      non-antialiased, non-TrueType built-in GD fonts.

2007-04-04 karl
    * Document the animated GIF support.

2006-01-10 Karl Lehenbauer
    * configure.in: Remove pkgIndex.tcl from list of files that are to
      be deleted on "make clean" -- since it's now generated from 
      pkgIndex.tcl.in (updated TEA), it should only be cleaned by
      make distclean, not make clean.

2006-01-10 Karl Lehenbauer
    * generic/tclgd.c: Fix filled_arc to require the correct number of
      parameters (it required one too many) and to handle optional
      parameters correctly (it would only use the first one, when
      multiple are allowed.)

2005-12-18 Karl Lehenbauer

    * generic/tclgdio.c: Use Tcl's ckalloc and ckfree instead of GD's
      gdMalloc and gdFree -- it wasn't necessary to use GD's versions,
      and this keeps us from needing to access GD functions that are
      not declared in gd.h plus it lets us use Tcl's memory debugging
      capabilities to determine if we're leaking anything here.

    * doc/tclgd.n:  Added an admonition of the importance of configuring
      channels for binary tranlation when loading and saving images.

    * README, mapserver-patches/README: Improve docs, explain how to use
      the C function to bring a GD image structure into Tcl from a C
      program.  Better document the Mapserver patch.

2005-12-14 Karl Lehenbauer
    * Update to Tcl TEA build environment version 3.4.

    * configure.in: Enforce GD version must be at least 2.0.33 (we need
      features therein, like "gdlib-config --features" needs to work.)

    * generic/tclgd.c: Compile properly when gd was built without GIF support.

    * generic/tclgd.c: Compile properly when gd was built without JPEG support.

2005-11-26 Karl Lehenbauer

    * generic/tclgd.c: "text_bounds" method was still rendering into the
      target image because we weren't passing a null target image when
      we wanted the bounds.

    * configure.in: Use TEA_ADD_HEADERS([generic/tclgd.h]) to cause tclgd.h
      to get installed into the runtime include directory.  This is needed
      for any C applications that link with tcl.gd, specifically our
      patch to link us up with Mapserver.

    * Release version 0.6

2005-11-25 Karl Lehenbauer

    * generic/tclgd.c: Make "handle transparent" return the current 
      transparency color index if no color is specified.  Also when it 
      is specified, require it to be a color number, not that or possibly 
      one of the color aliases.

    * generic/tclgdio.c: Panic if the size written doesn't equal the size
      requested, but since we're using Tcl_Write I don't think that is
      likely to happen.  If it does, we have to panic because GD's
      ioctx stuff doesn't have a way to return an error.

    * mapserver-patches/(README,mapscript-image.i.patch,pkgIndex.tcl.patch): 
      Document and store the patch to Mapserver/Mapscript to allow us to 
      bind one of our tclgd command objects to the gd buffer contained in 
      Mapscript image object.

    * created new tclgd_newGDObjectAttach API for external C programs that
      have a gdImagePtr and want to have a new command object attached to 
      that image pointer that will invoke all of our tclgd magic against it.

    * doc/tclgd_newGDObjectAttach.3: Documentation for the above API.

2005-11-22 Karl Lehenbauer

    * Fix minor memory leak where tclgd_channelIOCtx structures weren't
      being freed after writing images to Tcl channels.

2005-11-01 Karl Lehenbauer

    * Export
